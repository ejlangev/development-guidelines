# General Principles

## Guiding principles

* The vast majority of engineering time is spent trying to understand
  existing code and then modify it rather than to write new code. Over
  the lifetime of a piece of code it will be read many more times than
  it will be modified.  Thus it makes sense to do some optimization for readability
  and understandability even if it might take some extra time to write the
  code.
* Having basic conventions for code within a team is more important than what
  those conventions are. Most preferences about code are somewhat
  arbitrary, it is more important to pick something than to try to find
  the global maximum of all conventions.
* Organizing code around structural patterns not only makes reading and
  understanding the code faster across the team but also provides a
  shared language to give feedback about the design and organization of
  a specific piece of code.

## SOLID

SOLID is a set of design principles that guide the development of all
object oriented software.  Applying them can help you write code that
is easier to understand and maintain and more importantly easy for other
people to read and follow.
